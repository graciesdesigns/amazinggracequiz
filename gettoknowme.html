                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>I am currently a student at NJIT pursuing a degree in Information Technology with a focus in UX Design. 
                My dream career is to become a front-end developer and a UX Designer. 
                <br>
                I hope this helped you to get to know who I am as a person a little bit. I thought it would be a cool idea to introduce myself to
                people through coding and design :3</p>

                <h3>Why did I create AGQ?</h3>
                <p>I created the Amazing Grace Quiz in 2022. I was a incoming junior in high school and I was just figuring out I wanted to study computer science in college. 
                    Just to test if I would like coding, I did a course on HTML and through that, I had an idea to build my own project. Little by little, I practiced on making HTML forms and using CSS to style and edit my webpage.
                After 3 years of putting the project in hiatus, the summer before my 2nd year of college, I decided to jump right back into it, to develop and learn more front-end skills and fundementals.
            I learned many Javascript uses and DOM manipulation along with many CSS tags that can change the way my web page looks. It took a lot of dedication and I am very proud of how far I've come with my very first project. 
            I hope you see the vision like I did.</p>

                <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                <p>Outside of academics here are a few of my favorite hobbies:
                    <li>Listening to music: I love listening to Tems and PARTYNEXTDOOR. My favorite song from Tems is Interference and my favorite song from PND is Grown Woman.</li>
                    <li>Reading: I love reading once in a while, although I don't have time to do it as much as I use to, my favorite books are, It Ends With Us, The Shatter Me Series and The Other Wes Moore</li>
                    <li>Writing: I like writing about anything to be honest. I have a blog called Grace Outspoken where I write anything that comes to mind and would like to share to the world.</li>
                    <li>Painting: Anytime I get the chance, I always like to paint. It's very calming and I love how I can do whatever I want with my painting.</li>
